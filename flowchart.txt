1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset - crop recommendation data
3. Data processing and cleaning
	- using Pandas Dataframe
	- Eliminating all Duplicated Rows - Balanced Data
4. Visualization the data using seaborn and matplotlib
5. label Encoding
	- Processing the Data str to int
6. Feature Selection Algorithm
	- SMOTE
	- ROSE
	- RFE
	- MRFE
	- BORUTA
	- MEMOTE
6. Splitting the data to train and test
7. Building the model with and without feature selection
	
	- KNN
	- Naive Bayes
	- Bagging Classifier
	- Random Forest
	- Decision Tree
	- SVM
	- Gradient Boosting
	- Voting Classifier ( RF + DT + SVC)
   
8. Training the model
9. Building the model with Voting Classifier since it gives better accuracy comparing with Other Models 
10. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
11. Importing the packages
12. User gives input as Feature Values 
13. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
14. Trained model is used for prediction
15. Final outcome is displayed through frontend
Extension 
â€”----------
In the base paper, the author mentioned Machine Learning models (NB,Bagging,RF,DT,SVM),in which RF got 87%, 
As an extension we have applied Voting Classifier and Gradient Boosting, in which Voting Classifier got 99.7% 
So with Voting Classifier we build the model is used for predicting the results
